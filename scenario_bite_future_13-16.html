        <h2>3. Introduction and Motivation</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our exciting workshop, "A Bite of the Future!" Today, we face big challenges like climate change, pollution, and food waste. But science and technology offer new, exciting solutions: meat grown in a lab, snacks made from insects, farms inside city buildings, and packaging that disappears!</p>
        <p>To begin, we will watch the short video "Future Food" and then consider these questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Would you eat something "unusual" (like insects or lab-grown meat) if you knew it could help save the planet? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>What seemed the strangest and what seemed the most interesting thing from the video?</li>
            <li>Do you think we will really have to change the way we eat in the future? How do you imagine that change?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Research and Learning</h2>
        
        <h3>Activity 4.1: Dividing into teams (3-5 students)</h3>
        <p>To form teams, each student will draw a picture from a box (e.g., a purple cow, blue lettuce, a cricket, a tomato on water). These pictures correspond to the research topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blue lettuce - Vertical Farming:</strong> growing food inside city buildings</li>
            <li><strong>A purple cow - Lab-Grown Meat:</strong> meat produced without animals</li>
            <li><strong>A cricket - Insect-Based Nutrition:</strong> energy- and nutrient-rich food</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato in a glass - Aquaponics and Hydroponics:</strong> growing fish and plants without soil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Activity 4.2: Researching Worksheet</h3>
        <p>Students will work in their teams to answer the following questions based on their research.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What is it?</li>
            <li>What problem does it solve?</li>
            <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages?</li>
            <li>Does it already exist here or in the world?</li>
            <li>Would you use it? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>What does ChatGPT or any other ChatBot say about the use of this kind of technology?</li>
            <li>Are the results you got from ChatGPT consistent with information from expert sources?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Use reliable sources from the list provided. Write your answers in full sentences. When answering opinion questions, explain your reasoning. For the ChatGPT question, you can ask it directly, summarize its response in your own words, and compare the information with what you find in expert sources. Don't forget to write a source of information in every answer!</p>

        <h2>5. Creative Application</h2>
        
        <h3>Activity 5.1: Designing an e-Book</h3>
        <p>Students will continue to work in teams using Book Creator (recommended) or Canva. Your book should include 9 pages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Title (e.g. "On the Plate in 2050: Vertical Farming")</li>
            <li>What it is (brief explanation of the technology)</li>
            <li>How it works?</li>
            <li>Does it already exist here or in the world?</li>
            <li>Positive and Negative aspects and reasons</li>
            <li>Would you use it? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>ChatGPT's opinion and comparison with expert sources</li>
            <li>Your message to society: why is this idea important for our future?</li>
            <li>Literature</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your page should include an image you create with an AI image generator. Publish your work and share a link with others in Teams/Padlet.</p>
