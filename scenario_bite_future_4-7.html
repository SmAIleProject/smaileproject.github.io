        <h2>3. Introduction and Motivation</h2>
        <h3>Story: Farmer Ella and the Helpful Robots</h3>
        
        <img src="attachments/scenario_bite_future_4-7_img1.png" alt="Farmer Ella and her robot helpers" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin: 20px auto; border-radius: 8px;">

        <p>Once upon a time, there was a clever farmer named Ella. She lived on a big, sunny farm where she grew carrots, apples, and lettuce. But Ella didn’t do it all by herself—she had <strong>robot friends</strong> and a super smart <strong>computer helper</strong>!</p>
        
        <p>One robot, named <strong>Picksy</strong>, had long arms and wheels. Picksy zoomed through the apple orchard. "Beep! Beep! Ripe apple spotted!" With a gentle grip, Picksy picked red apples and placed them into baskets.</p>
        
        <p>Another robot, called <strong>Sprinkles</strong>, helped water the vegetables. But Sprinkles didn’t just spray water everywhere! A <strong>smart computer with AI</strong> told Sprinkles: <em>"The lettuce is thirsty today, but the carrots are just fine!"</em> So Sprinkles only watered what needed it.</p>
        
        <p>Inside the barn was the brain of it all: a smart AI computer named <strong>Brainy</strong>. Brainy didn’t have arms or legs, but she was super helpful! She checked the weather and told Farmer Ella: <em>"Tomorrow will be sunny—great for planting potatoes!"</em></p>
        
        <p>At bedtime, Farmer Ella smiled. "Thank you, robots," she said. "Together, we grow good food for everyone!"</p>

        <h2>4. Research and Learning</h2>
        <h3>Role-Play: Farmer Ella's Smart Farm</h3>
        <p><strong>Set the Scene:</strong> transform the classroom into the farm.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plants:</strong> Some students pretend to be lettuce or strawberries.</li>
            <li><strong>Robots:</strong> "Picksy" (picker) and "Sprinkles" (waterer).</li>
            <li><strong>AI ("Brainy"):</strong> One student (or teacher) gives commands based on clues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example Commands:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>"Only water the plants that are droopy."</em></li>
            <li><em>"Pick the strawberries that are red."</em></li>
            <li><em>"Don't water today, it's raining!"</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Creative Application</h2>
        <h3>Design Your Own Food Robot</h3>
        <p>Each child creates their own food robot helper on paper.</p>
        <p><strong>Prompts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is your robot's name?</li>
            <li>What job does it do?</li>
            <li>Sentence starter: <em>"My robot helps by..."</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Reflection and Evaluation</h2>
        <h3>Class Reflection Circle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What was it like to be the AI or robot?</li>
            <li>What job would YOU give a food robot?</li>
        </ul>
