        <h2>3. Introduction and Motivation </h2>
        <p>Welcome to our exciting debate session on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ethics! 
            Today, we dive into a world where technology meets human values. 
            As our planet becomes more connected and technologically advanced, AI plays a significant role in shaping our daily lives, from virtual assistants to autonomous vehicles. 
            However, with great advancements come great responsibilities.  The ethical implications of AI-how we should use it responsibly, ensure fairness, and protect privacy are crucial topics of discussion. 
            This debate will allow you to explore these important issues, develop your own opinions, and learn how to express them clearly and persuasively. </p>

        <h2>4. Research and Learning </h2>
        <p>Students will be divided into teams to research and debate one of the following topics. 
            Each topic includes a scenario, thought-provoking questions, and arguments to guide research. </p>
        
        <h3>Topic 4.1: AI in Education </h3>
        
        <h4>Activity 1: School Surveillance "Should AI be used to monitor students in schools?" </h4>
        <p>It is the year 2035.  Schools are using Al-powered surveillance to monitor students via cameras, facial recognition, and behavioral analysis to detect attention levels, rule adherence, and even stress. 
            Some believe this improves safety, but others fear it invades privacy and could lead to unfair punishments. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How would you feel if cameras were constantly watching your face and body language? </li>
            <li>Would you behave differently if you knew an Al was tracking your focus? </li>
            <li>What could go wrong if the AI makes a mistake? </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Activity 2: AI Tools in Class - "Should schools teach students how to use AI tools?" </h4>
        <p>You remember ChatGPT while stuck on homework.  It gives a clear answer in seconds. 
            Some students already use Al to study smarter, but others copy without thinking. 
            Teachers are split: some see AI as the future, others as a shortcut to lazy learning. 
            Should schools ban AI, or teach students how to use it responsibly? </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does using AI make students smarter, or just better at copying? </li>
            <li>Could relying on AI tools make your brain lazy over time? </li>
            <li>What happens to students who don't have access to AI tools? </li>

        <h3>Topic 4.2: AI and Ethics </h3>

        <h4>Activity 1: AI in Medicine - "Should decisions about patient care be made by AI or by human doctors?" </h4>
        <p>Imagine a robot scans your symptoms, checks your records, and instantly gives a diagnosis and prescription before you even see a doctor. 
            Would you trust it? 
            Can Al make better decisions than tired, overworked doctors? </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What happens if the AI makes a mistake?  How does it learn? </li>
            <li>Is it fair if only some people get access to high-tech care? </li>
        </ul>
